# Human Action Recognition – Graph Neural Networks (ST-GCN, AGCN, CTR-GCN)

## Master’s Thesis Code Repository — Khuloud Halimeh

This repository includes the implementation, experimental procedures, and evaluation code for **my master's thesis on skeleton-based Human Action Recognition (HAR) utilizing Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and Spatio-Temporal Deep Learning**.

The project involves training and evaluating models such as **ST-GCN, AGCN, CTR-GCN**, and enhanced GCN variants for the purpose of classifying human activities based on skeleton sequences.
## Implemented Models

* AGCN - Adaptive Graph Convolutional Network
* CTR-GCN — Channel-specific Topology Refinement Graph Convolutional Network
* Enhancements to Shift-GCN
* Experiments with batch sizes of 48, 64, and 72
* Numerous model enhancement experiments
* Implementations of deep learning using Python and PyTorch

## Principal Attributes

* Comprehensive preprocessing and training pipeline
* Skeleton sequence loading and augmentation
* GPU-accelerated training with Google Colab with CUDA
  
**Measurements**:

* Accuracy and Sensitivity
* Confusion Matrix
* Cross-Subject (X-Sub) and Cross-View (X-View) assessments
* Various enhancement models for experimentation

## Summary of Research

My thesis assesses and enhances graph-based models for human action recognition utilizing skeletal data.
The aims include the following:

* Constructing resilient Human Activity Recognition models via Graph Convolutional Network topologies
* Evaluating ST-GCN, AGCN, CTR-GCN, and their enhanced variations
